This is a keyboard I made for myself. Since I like the HHKB Style, I have made some modifications based on HHKB Layout.



## Dev. Info
- MPU : STM32F103RCT6

- IDE : STM32CubeIDE

- ECAD : EasyEDA Pro

- PCB and PCBA were manufactured through JLCPCB( [jlcpcb.com](https://jlcpcb.com/) )
        
  
  
## Issue
 - Currently, Volume Up/Down and Mute key is not operated.
